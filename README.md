# CellPhoneDB

## What is CellPhoneDB?
CellPhoneDB is a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and its interactions. Subunit architecture is included for both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies.

CellPhoneDB integrates [existing datasets](Docs/ppi-resources.md) that pertain to cellular communication and new manually reviewed information. Prestigious databases CellPhoneDB gets information are: UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, the IMEx consortium, IUPHAR.

CellPhoneDB can be used to search for a particular ligand/receptor or interrogate your own single-cell transcriptomics data.


## Starting to use CellPhoneDB 

To start using CellPhoneDB, you can use our interactive web ([cellphonedb.org](https://www.cellphonedb.org)) and run in the analysis in our private cloud, 
or just run CellPhoneDB in your computer/cloud/farm. Please, take the second way if you are going to work with big datasets).

This are the use guides to start to work in your system:

- [Quickstart for Linux/macOS systems](Docs/QuickStartLinuxMacos.md)
- [QuickStart for Windows systems](Docs/QuickStartWindows.md)


Please check [result documentation](Docs/RESULTS-DOCUMENTATION.md) for underestand the results.
